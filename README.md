## 🚀 Coding Projects and Research Experience

### **Graph-Based LSTM for Crime Forecasting**
*Computational and Applied Math Research, UCLA*  
*June 2024 - August 2024*  
- Developed **Graph-Based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models to predict crime hotspots using spatiotemporal crime data.
- Implemented a **novel cross-correlation algorithm** to enhance model accuracy.
- Optimized coverage of hotspots using **weighted triple-coverage algorithms** with gunshot detector data, aiding community intervention strategies.

### **Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews**
*Guided Research, UCLA*  
*January 2024 - May 2024*  
- Conducted sentiment analysis on over **900,000 Amazon product reviews** to identify common consumer concerns.
- Built a recommendation system to suggest alternative products based on negative review patterns.
- Utilized Python and machine learning tools to achieve insights from large datasets.

### **Rating Prediction from Text Reviews**
*Research Publication*  
*March 2022 - June 2022*  
- Co-authored a paper on **Continuous Semi-Supervised Nonnegative Matrix Factorization** for the 2023 Special Issue of *Algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations*.
- Developed a Python-based machine learning model to predict ratings from text reviews (Amazon, RateMyProfessor) with a **96%+ accuracy rate**, outperforming existing models.

### **Optimization of Liquidity Pool Allocations**
*SIAG/FME CodeQuest, UCLA*  
*December 2023 - January 2024*  
- Designed and implemented an algorithm to optimize liquidity pool allocations using **stochastic gradient descent**.
- Achieved a **45% performance improvement** and **reduced Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) by 50%** using Python and financial mathematics techniques.
